# 🌍 Travel Package Purchase Prediction

A **Machine Learning web application** that predicts whether a customer will purchase a travel package based on demographic, behavioral, and pitch-related features.  
The project uses a trained ML model with preprocessing and an interactive **Streamlit** interface for real-time predictions.

## 📖 Project Overview

Travel companies often struggle to identify customers who are most likely to purchase travel packages after a sales pitch.  
This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict customer purchase behavior, helping businesses improve **targeted marketing** and **conversion rates**.

The application allows users to enter customer details and instantly get a prediction using a trained model.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Given customer demographic and interaction data, predict whether a customer will **purchase a travel package** (`Yes / No`).

---

## 🛠 Solution Approach

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Handling categorical and numerical features using `ColumnTransformer`  
3. Model training and evaluation  
4. Saving trained model and preprocessor  
5. Building an interactive Streamlit web app for predictions

## 🧠 Model & Preprocessing

- A machine learning classification model was trained on customer data.
- A `ColumnTransformer` was used to preprocess data:
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Encoding categorical features
- Both the trained model and preprocessor were saved and reused during inference.

---

## 🌐 Web Application (Streamlit)

- Clean, dark-themed UI  
- Inputs arranged in a **3-column grid layout**  
- Controlled inputs using number fields and dropdowns  
- Centered **Predict** button  
- Displays prediction result with probability  
- Celebration animation for positive predictions 🎉
